          Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service
          created and hosted by the San Franciscoâ€“based independent research lab
          Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language
          descriptions, called prompts, similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stability
          AI's Stable Diffusion. It is one of the technologies of the AI boom.
